<h4>Professional Expertise</h4>
<p>I hold an MBA in finance and have extensive experience in business analysis, particularly in the finance and healthcare sector. Currently, I am working on an Electronic Patient Record system project within a hospital environment, where I collaborate with clinicians to streamline medication management processes. My role involves identifying and implementing effective solutions to improve patient care and ensure optimal data utilization.</p>

<p>In my pursuit of continuous improvement, I am enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and the IBM Full Stack Software Developer course. This education is enhancing my technical skills, particularly in front-end development using React. My previous experience in stock market analysis has also sharpened my ability to identify trends and make data-driven predictions, further enriching my analytical capabilities.</p>

<h4>Personal Interests</h4>
<p>Outside of my professional life, I am deeply interested in spirituality, particularly within the Hare Krishna tradition. Meditation and chanting are essential components of my daily routine, providing me with clarity and focus. I also enjoy spending time with my family, engaging in outdoor activities, and pursuing my passion for gaming, especially in Roblox, where I immerse myself in the world of Vesteria.</p>

<h4>Commitment to Growth</h4>
<p>I believe in the power of lifelong learning and am excited about the future possibilities that lie ahead. My goal is to leverage my skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact in my next role while continuously expanding my knowledge in data analytics and software development.</p>
